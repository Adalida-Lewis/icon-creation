## Software for Icon Creation
For icon creation, you will need some form of image creation software. Below is a list of free programs that you can use. They're all great, but which you use is personal preference.
- [Paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/download.html "Paint.net download")
- [Krita](https://krita.org/en/download/krita-desktop/ "Krita Download") (Similar to Photoshop)
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/ "GIMP Download")

## Device Icon Demo
It's time to talk about creation of the icon that will be shown on your device's home screen. For this, we will use paint.net.

Once our icon is created, visit this link: [App Icon Maker](https://appiconmaker.co/)
This site is useful in generating all icon sizes for iOS, Android and Smartwatches.
