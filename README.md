## What Goes Into a Good Icon?
From [this](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/01/designing-better-app-icons/ "App Icons") article here, there are many things that go into good icon design. While that article specifically talks about app icon design, it can be applied to more than just icons for apps.

The most important are
1. Scalability - making sure the icon will still look decent at higher and lower resolutions
2. Recognizability - making sure the icon stands out
3. Uniqueness
4. Don't Use Words

## Software for Icon Creation
